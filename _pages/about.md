<p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to my web page! I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanics under the supervision of Prof. François Gallaire in the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi'>Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities</a> at <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en'>EPFL</a>; currently on a mobility stay with Prof. Sylvain Courrech du Pont in the <a href='https://msc.u-paris.fr'>Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes</a> in Paris. My research interests lie at the intersection of the hydrodynamic stability of thin-film flows, coupled to heat and/or mass transfer, and geo-morphogenesis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I am originally from Sofia and presently based between Paris and Lausanne. Before starting my doctorate, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from <a href='https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en'>Université de Bordeaux</a>, followed by a Master's degree in Fundamental Physics and Applications from <a href='https://univ-cotedazur.eu'>Université Côte d'Azur</a>.</p>

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
