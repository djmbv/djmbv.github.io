  abstract = {In turbulent rough-walled flows, the 2D friction–roughness relation differs from its 3D counterpart. The friction \( f \)&nbsp; is the property of wall-bounded flows that sets the pumping cost of a pipeline, the draining capacity of a river, and other variables of practical relevance. For highly turbulent rough-walled pipe flows, \( f \)&nbsp; depends solely on the roughness length scale \( r\), and the \( f \)–\( r \)&nbsp; relation may be expressed by the Strickler empirical scaling \( f \propto r^\{1/3\}\). Here, we show experimentally that for soap film flows that are the two-dimensional (2D) equivalent of highly turbulent rough-walled pipe flows, \( f \propto r \)&nbsp; and the \( f \)–\( r \)&nbsp; relation is not the same in 2D as in 3D. Our findings are beyond the purview of the standard theory of friction but consistent with a competing theory in which $f$ is linked to the turbulent spectrum via the spectral exponent \( \alpha\): In 3D, \( \alpha = 5/3\), and the theory yields \( f \propto r^\{1/3\}\); in 2D, \(\alpha = 3\), and the theory yields \( f \propto r\).}

  abstract={The present paper concerns the linear fate of transverse perturbations in a gravity-driven, thin-film flow over a soluble substrate. We propose a reduced-order model, based on a boundary-layer treatment of the solute transport and a depth-integration of the Stokes equations, using two extended lubrication methodologies found in the literature. We obtain a closed-form dispersion relation, which we compare to a previous, fully resolved analytical investigation (Bertagni and Camporeale, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 913, 2021, A34). The results allow us to distil the essential physical mechanisms behind the instability.}
